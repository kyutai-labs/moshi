"""Quantization based on bitsandbytes, supporting only 8 bits for now.
We are taking from freedom from the intended use of bnb:

- we are not replacing Linear with Linear8bitLt, but rely instead of the explicit use
    of the `linear(module, x)` function.
- for multi linears (e.g. per timestep weights in the Depth Transformer), we instead use the
    `multi_linear` function.
