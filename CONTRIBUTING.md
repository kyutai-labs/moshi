# Contributing to Moshi

## Pull Requests

Moshi is the implementation of a research paper.
Therefore, we do not plan on accepting many pull requests for new features.
However, we certainly welcome them for bug fixes.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you have changed APIs, update the documentation accordingly.
3. Ensure pre-commit hooks pass properly, in particular the linting and typing.
4. When changing the Rust code, run `cargo check`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo test`.
5. Accept the Contributor License Agreement (see after).

Note that in general, we will not accept refactoring of the code.
